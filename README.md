ðŸ§® Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to predict the Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers based on historical purchase data. Accurate LTV predictions enable better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn)

Excel (for initial data exploration)

Jupyter Notebook (program.ipynb)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
customers.csv: Customer ID and demographic info

transactions.csv: Purchase history including date and order value

ðŸ”„ Process Overview
1. Data Preprocessing
Merged customers.csv and transactions.csv using CustomerID

Removed nulls, duplicates, and ensured date formatting

2. Feature Engineering
Frequency: Number of purchases per customer

Recency: Days since last purchase

Average Order Value (AOV): Mean order value per customer

3. Modeling
Trained XGBoost Regressor for LTV prediction

Evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

4. Segmentation
Classified customers into segments based on predicted LTV (e.g., High, Medium, Low)

ðŸ“Š Visualization
Included ltv_distribution.png for LTV prediction distribution

Other visual insights available in the Jupyter notebook

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
program.ipynb: Full code with explanations and outputs

ltv_distribution.png: Visual of predicted LTVs

ltv_predictions.csv: Final LTV predictions per customer

Trained XGBoost model (optional .pkl file)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone repo

Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run program.ipynb step-by-step

Review ltv_predictions.csv for output

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
| CustomerID | Predicted_LTV |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 10234      | 1345.78        |
| 10235      | 456.23         |
